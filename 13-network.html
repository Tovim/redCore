<h2 id="section-2">2. REBOL Networking Basics</h2>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-2.1">2.1 Modes of Operation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two basic modes of network operation: atomic and port-based.</p>
<p><tt>Atomic</tt> network operations are those that are accomplished in
a single function. For instance, you can read an entire Web page with a single
call to the read function. There is no need to separately open a connection or
set up the read. All of that is done automatically as part of the read. For
example, you can type:</p>
<pre>
print read http://www.rebol.com
</pre>
<p>The host is found and opened, its Web page transferred, and the connection
closed.</p>
<p>The <tt>port-based</tt> mode of operation is one that uses a more
traditional programming approach. It involves opening a port and performing
various series operations on the port. For instance, if you want to read your
email from a POP server one message at a time, you would use this method. Here
is an example that reads and displays all of your email:</p>
<pre>
pop: open pop://user:pass@mail.example.com
forall pop [print first pop]
close pop
</pre>
<p>The atomic method of operation is easier, but it is also more limited. The
port-based method allows more types of operations, but also requires a greater
understanding of networking.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-2.2">2.2 Specifying Network Resources</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>REBOL provides two approaches for specifying network resources: URLs and port
specifications.</p>
<p><tt>Uniform</tt> Resource Locators (URL) are used on the Internet to
identify a network resource, such as a Web page, FTP site, email address, file,
or other resource or service. URLs are integral to the operation of REBOL, and
they can be expressed directly in the language.</p>
<p>The standard notation for URLs consists of a <tt>scheme</tt> followed
by a specification:</p>
<pre>
scheme:specification
</pre>
<p>The scheme is often the name of a protocol, such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and POP;
however, that is not a requirement. A scheme can be any name that identifies the
method used to access a resource.</p>
<p>The format of a scheme's specification depends on the scheme; however, most
schemes share a common format for identifying network hosts, user names,
passwords, port numbers, and file paths. Here are a few commonly used
formats:</p>
<pre>
scheme://host

scheme://host:port

scheme://user@host

scheme://user:pass@host

scheme://user:pass@host:port

scheme://host/path

scheme://host:port/path

scheme://user@host/path

scheme://user:pass@host/path

scheme://user:pass@host:port/path
</pre>
<p><A href="#76862">Network Resource Specification</A> lists the
fields used in the above formats.</p>
<table cellspacing="6" border="0" width="95%">
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>scheme</b></td><td valign="top">The name used to identify the type of resource, often
the same as the  protocol. For example, HTTP, FTP, and POP.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>host</b></td><td valign="top">The network name or address for a machine. For example,
www.rebol.com,  <C>cnn.com, accounting.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>port</b></td><td valign="top">Port number on the host machine for the scheme being
used. Normally  there is a default for this, so it is not
required most of the time.  Examples: 21, 23, 80, 8000.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>user</b></td><td valign="top">A user name to access the resource.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>pass</b></td><td valign="top">A password to verify the user name.
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="20">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="80"><b>path</b></td><td valign="top">A file path or some other method for referencing the
resource. This is  scheme dependent. Some schemes include
patterns and script arguments (such  as CGI).
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Another way to identify a resource is with a REBOL <tt>port</tt>
specification. In fact, when a URL is used, it is automatically
converted into a port specification. A port specification can accept many more
arguments than a URL, but it requires multiple lines to express.</p>
<p>A port specification is written as an object block definition that provides
each of the parameters necessary to access the network resource. For instance,
the URL to access a Web site is:</p>
<pre>
read http://www.rebol.com/developer.html
</pre>
<p>but, it can also be written as:</p>
<pre>
read [
    scheme: 'HTTP
    host: "www.rebol.com"
    target: %/developer.html
]
</pre>
<p>The URL for an FTP read can be:</p>
<pre>
read ftp://bill:vbs@ftp.example.com:8000/file.txt
</pre>
<p>but, it can also be written as:</p>
<pre>
read [
    scheme: 'FTP
    host: "ftp.example.com"
    port-id: 8000
    target: %/file.txt
    user: "bill"
    pass: "vbs"
]
</pre>
<p>In addition, there are many other port fields that can be specified, such as
timeout, type of access, and security.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-2.3">2.3 Schemes, Handlers, and Protocols</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>REBOL networking operates by using <tt>schemes</tt> to identify
<tt>handlers</tt> that communicate with <tt>protocols</tt>.</p>
<p>In REBOL a <tt>scheme</tt> is used to identify the method of accessing
a resource. That method uses a code object that is called a
<tt>handler</tt>. Each of the URL schemes that are supported by REBOL
(such as HTTP, FTP) has a handler. The list of schemes can be obtained with:</p>
<pre>
probe next first system/schemes
<span class="put">[default Finger Whois Daytime SMTP POP HTTP FTP NNTP]</span>
</pre>
<p>In addition, there are lower level scheme names that are not shown here. For
instance, the TCP and UDP schemes are used for direct, lower level
communication.</p>
<p>New schemes can be added to this list. For instance, you can define your own
scheme, called FTP2, that provides special features for FTP access, such as
automatically supplying your username and password so it does not need to be
included in every FTP URL.</p>
<p>Most handlers are used to provide an interface to a network protocol. A
<tt>protocol</tt> is used to communicate between various devices,
including clients and servers.</p>
<p>Although each protocol is quite different in how it communicates, it does
have some things in common with other protocols. For instance, most protocols
require a network connection to be opened, read, written, and closed. These
common operations are performed by a default handler in REBOL. This handler
makes protocols like finger, whois, and daytime almost trivial to implement.</p>
<p>Scheme handlers are written as objects. The default handler serves as the
root object for all the other handlers. When a handler requires a particular
field, such as a timeout value to use for reading data, if the value is not
defined in the specific handler, it will be provided by the default handler.
Hence, handlers overlay one another with their fields and value. You can also
create handlers that use other handlers for default values. For instance, you
can create an FTP2 handler that looks for missing fields first in the FTP
handler, then in the default handler.</p>
<p>When a port is used to access network resources, it is linked to a specific
handler. The handler and the port together form the unit that is used to provide
the data, code, and state information to process all protocols.</p>
<p>The source code to handlers can be obtained from the system/scheme object.
This can be useful if you want to modify the behavior of a handler or build your
own handler. For instance, to view the code for the whois handler, type:</p>
<pre>
probe get in system/schemes 'whois
</pre>
<p>Note that what you are seeing is a composite of the default handler with the
whois handler. The actual source code that is used to create the whois handler
is only a few lines:</p>
<pre>
make Root-Protocol [
    open-check:  [[any [port/user ""]] none]
    net-utils/net-install Whois make self [] 43
]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-2.4">2.4 Monitoring Handlers</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>For debugging purposes, you can monitor the actions of any handler. Each
handler has its own debugging output to indicate what operations are being
performed. To enable network debugging, turn network tracing on with the
line:</p>
<pre>
trace/net on
</pre>
<p>To turn network debugging off, use:</p>
<pre>
trace/net off
</pre>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre>
read pop://carl:poof@zen.example.com
<span class="put">URL Parse: carl poof zen.example.com none none none
Net-log: ["Opening tcp for" POP]
connecting to: zen.example.com
Net-log: [none "+OK"]
Net-log: {+OK QPOP (version 2.53) at zen.example.com starting.}
Net-log: [["USER" port/user] "+OK"]
Net-log: "+OK Password required for carl."
Net-log: [["PASS" port/pass] "+OK"]
** User Error: Server error: tcp -ERR Password supplied for "carl"
is incorrect.
** Where: read pop://carl:poof@zen.example.com</span>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-3">3. Initial Setup</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><A name=_Toc487519878></A>REBOL networking is built-in. To create scripts
that use the network protocols you do not need any special include files or
libraries. The only requirement is that you provide the basic information
necessary to enable protocols to connect to servers or through firewalls and
proxies. For instance, to send an email, the SMTP protocol needs an SMTP server
name and a reply email address.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-3.1">3.1 Basic Network Settings</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When you run REBOL the first time, you re prompted for the necessary network
settings, which is stored in the <tt>user</tt>.r file. REBOL uses this file to
load the required network settings each time it is started. If a <tt>user</tt>.r
is not created and REBOL cannot find an existing <tt>user</tt>.r file in its
paths, no settings are loaded. See the chapter on <A
href="rebolcore-3.html#_Toc487519750">Operation</A>
for more information.</p>
<p>To change the network settings, type <b><tt>set-user</tt></b> at the prompt.
This runs the same network configuration script that ran when REBOL first
started. This script is loaded from the <tt>rebol</tt>.r file. If that file
cannot be found, or if you want to edit the setting directly, you can use a text
editor on the <tt>user</tt>.r file.</p>
<p>Within the <tt>user</tt>.r file the network settings are found in a block
that follows the <b><tt>set-net</tt></b> function. At a minimum the block
should contain two items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your email address for use in the from and reply fields of email and for
anonymous FTP login</li>
<li>Your default server; this is also your primary email server</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you can specify a few other items:</p>
<ul>
<li>A different incoming email server (for POP)</li>
<li>A proxy server (for connecting to the network)</li>
<li>A proxy port number</li>
<li>A proxy type (see <A href="#62361">Proxy Settings</A> below).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also add lines after the <b><tt>set-net</tt></b> function to
configure other protocol values. For instance you can set the timeout values for
protocols, set the FTP passive mode, set the HTTP user-agent identifier, set up
separate proxies for different protocols, and more.</p>
<p>An example of <b><tt>set-net</tt></b> is:</p>
<pre>
set-net [user@domain.dom mail.server.dom]
</pre>
<p>The first field specifies your email from address, and the second field
indicates your default server (notice that it does not need quotes here). For
most networks, this is enough and no other settings are necessary (unless you
require a proxy). Also your default server is used whenever a specific server is
not provided.</p>
<p>In addition, if you use a POP server (for incoming email) that is different
from your SMTP server (for outgoing email), you can specify that as well:</p>
<pre>
set-net [
    user@domain.dom
    mail.server.dom
    pop.server.dom
]
</pre>
<p>However, if your SMTP and POP servers are the same, then this is not
necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-3.2">3.2 Proxy Settings</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If you use a proxy or firewall, you can provide the set-net function with
your proxy settings. This can include the proxy server name or address, a proxy
port number to access the server, and an optional proxy type. For example:</p>
<pre>
set-net [
    email@addr
    mail.example.com
    pop.example.com
    proxy.example.com
    1080
    socks
]
</pre>
<p>This example would use a proxy called <tt>proxy</tt>.example.com on its TCP
port 1080 with the socks proxy method. To use a socks4 proxy server, use the
word <tt>socks4</tt> rather than <tt>socks</tt>. To use the
generic CERN server, use the word <tt>generic</tt>.</p>
<p>You can also set the proxy to be different machines for different schemes
(protocols). Each protocol has its own proxy object where you can set the proxy
values for just that scheme. Here is an example of setting a proxy for FTP:</p>
<pre>
system/schemes/ftp/proxy/host: "proxy2.example.com"

system/schemes/ftp/proxy/port-id: 1080

system/schemes/ftp/proxy/type: 'socks
</pre>
<p>In this case, only FTP uses a special proxy server. Notice that the machine
name must be a string and the proxy type must be a literal word.</p>
<p>Here are two more examples. The first example sets the proxy for HTTP to be
the generic (CERN) proxy method:</p>
<pre>
system/schemes/http/proxy/host: "wp.example.com"

system/schemes/http/proxy/port-id: 8080

system/schemes/http/proxy/type: 'generic
</pre>
<p>In the above example, all HTTP requests go through a generic proxy on
<tt>wp</tt>.example.com using TCP port 8080.</p>
<p>If you want to disable the proxy settings for a particular scheme, you can
set the proxy fields to false.</p>
<pre>
system/schemes/smtp/proxy/host: false

system/schemes/smtp/proxy/port-id: false

system/schemes/smtp/proxy/type: false
</pre>
<p>In the above example, all outgoing email does not go through a proxy. The
<tt>false</tt> value prevents even the default proxy from being used. If you set
these fields to <tt>none</tt>, then the default proxy is used if it is
configured.</p>
<p>If you want to bypass the proxy settings for particular machines, such as
those on your local network, you can provide a bypass list. Here is a bypass
list for the default proxy:</p>
<pre>
system/schemes/default/proxy/bypass:
    ["host.example.net" "*.example.com"]
</pre>
<p>Note that the asterisk (*) and question mark (?) characters can be used for
pattern matching. The asterisk (*) as used in the example above bypasses any
machine that ends with <tt>example</tt>.com.</p>
<p>To set a bypass list for only the HTTP scheme, type:</p>
<pre>
system/schemes/http/proxy/bypass:
    ["host.example.net" "*.example.com"]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-3.3">3.3 Other Settings</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to proxy settings, you can set network timeout values for all of
the schemes (in the default) or for specific schemes. For instance, to increase
the timeout for all schemes, you can write:</p>
<pre>
system/schemes/default/timeout: 0:05
</pre>
<p>This sets the network timeout for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>If you want to increase the timeout just for SMTP, you would write:</p>
<pre>
system/schemes/smtp/timeout: 0:10
</pre>
<p>Some schemes have custom fields. For instance, the FTP scheme allows you to
set passive mode for all transfers:</p>
<pre>
system/schemes/ftp/passive: on
</pre>
<p>FTP passive mode is useful because FTP servers that are set to passive mode
do not attempt to connect back through your firewall.</p>
<p>When making HTTP accesses to Web sites, you may want to use a different
user-agent field in the HTTP request to get better results on a few sites that
detect the browser type:</p>
<pre>
system/schemes/http/user-agent: "Mozilla/4.0"
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-3.4">3.4 Access to Settings</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Each time REBOL is started, it reads the <tt>user</tt>.r file to find its

<h2 id="section-4">4. DNS - Domain Name Service</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>DNS is the network service that translates domain names to their associated
IP address. In addition, you can use DNS to find a machine and domain name from
an IP address.</p>
<p>The DNS protocol can be used in three ways: you can lookup the primary IP
address of a machine name, you can lookup the domain name for an IP address, and
you can find the name and IP address of your local system.</p>
<p>To lookup the primary IP address of a specific machine within a specific
domain, type:</p>
<pre>
print read dns://www.rebol.com
<span class="put">207.69.132.8</span>
</pre>
<p>You can also obtain the domain name that is associated with a particular IP
address:</p>
<pre>
print read dns://207.69.132.8
<span class="put">rebol.com</span>
</pre>
<p>Note that it is not unusual for this reverse DNS lookup to return a none.
There are machines that do not have host names.</p>
<pre>
print read dns://11.22.33.44
<span class="put">none</span>
</pre>
<p>To find your system's host name, read an empty DNS URL of the form:</p>
<pre>
print read dns://
<span class="put">crackerjack</span>
</pre>
<p>The data returned here depends on the type of machine. It may be the
unqualified host name, as shown above, but it can also be the fully-qualified
host name, <tt>crackerjack</tt>.example.com. This depends on the operating
system and the network configuration in the operating system.</p>
<p>Here's an example that looks up and prints the IP addresses for a number of
Web sites:</p>
<pre>
domains: [
    www.rebol.com
    www.rebol.org
    www.mochinet.com
    www.sirius.com
]

foreach domain domains [
    print ["address for" domain "is:"
        read join dns:// domain]
]
<span class="put">address for www.rebol.com is: 207.69.132.8
address for www.rebol.org is: 207.66.107.61
address for www.mochinet.com is: 216.127.92.70
address for www.sirius.com is: 205.134.224.1</span>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-5">5. Whois Protocol</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The whois protocol retrieves information about domain names from a central
registry. The whois service is provided by the organizations that run the
Internet. Whois is often used to retrieve registration information about an
Internet domain or server. It can tell you who owns the domain, how their
technical contact can be reached, along with other information.</p>
<p>To obtain information, use the <b><tt>read</tt></b> function with a whois
URL. This URL should contain the domain name and a whois server name separated
by an at sign (@). For example to obtain information about <tt>example</tt>.com
from the Internic registry:</p>
<pre>
print read whois://example.com@rs.internic.net
<span class="put">connecting to: rs.internic.net
Whois Server Version 1.1
Domain names in the .com, .net, and .org domains can now be
registered with many different competing registrars. Go to
http://www.internic.net for detailed information.

</pre>
<p><I>The above code is only an example. The details of the
information being returned and the servers that support whois
change over time.</I></p>
<p>If instead of a domain name you provide a word, all entries that match that
word are returned:</p>

<p><I>The whois protocol does not accept URLs, such as
<tt>www</tt>.example.com, unless the URL is part of the registrant's
company name.</I></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-6">6. Finger Protocol</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The finger protocol retrieves user-specific information stored in the user
log file.</p>
<p>To request user information from a server it must be running the finger
protocol. The information is requested by reading a finger URL that contains a
username and a domain name in an email style format:</p>
<pre>
print read finger://username@example.com
</pre>
<p>The above example retrieves information about the user at
<tt>username@example</tt>.com. The information returned depends on the
information provided by the user and the settings of the finger server. Also,
the details of the information being returned are up to each server; the
examples below only describe typical servers. Many servers can have non-standard
behaviors on their finger ports.</p>
<p>For instance, the following information may be returned:</p>
<pre>
<span class="put">Login: username
Name: Firstname Lastname
Directory: /home/user
Shell: /usr/local/bin/tcsh
Office: City, State +1 555 555 5555
Last login Wed Jul 28 01:10 (PDT) on ttyp0 from some.example.com
No Mail.
No Plan.</span>
</pre>
<p>Notice that finger reports when the user last logged in from a machine, and
whether the user has mail waiting. If the user reads email from this account,
finger sometimes reports when mail was received and when the user last retrieved
email:</p>
<pre>
<span class="put">New mail received Sun Sep 26 11:39 1999 (PDT)
Unread since Tue Sep 21 04:45 1999 (PDT)</span>
</pre>
<p>The finger server can also report the contents of a <tt>plan</tt> file and a
<tt>project</tt> file if they exist. Users can include any information they want
in a <tt>plan</tt> or <tt>project</tt> file.</p>
<p>It is also possible to retrieve information about users using their real
first name or their last name. Some finger servers require that you capitalize
the names exactly as they appear in the login file or in the file used by the
online finger server, to retrieve user information. Other finger servers are
more liberal about capitalization. A finger server will respond to real name
queries by returning all listings that match the query criteria. For instance,
if there are several users on a host that have the first name <tt>zaphod</tt>,
then entering the query</p>
<pre>
print read finger://Zaphod@main.example.com
</pre>
<p>will retrieve all such users whose first or last name is <tt>Zaphod</tt>.</p>
<p>Some finger servers return a listing of users when the user name is omitted.
For example,</p>
<pre>
print read finger://main.example.com
</pre>
<p>retrieves a list of all users who are logged onto the machine, if the finger
service installed on the hosting machine allows it.</p>
<p>Some host machines limit finger services for security reasons. They may
require a valid username and only return information regarding that user. If you
finger such a server without providing user information, the server will report
that it requires specific user information.</p>
<p>If a system does not support the finger protocol, REBOL reports an access
error:</p>
<pre>
print read finger://host.dom
connecting to: host.dom
Access Error: Cannot connect to host.dom.
Where: print read finger://host.dom
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-7">7. Daytime - Network Time Protocol</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The daytime protocol retrieves the current day and time. To connect to a
daytime server use <b><tt>read</tt></b> with a daytime URL. The URL contains the name of
the server to read the date from:</p>
<pre>
print read daytime://everest.cclabs.missouri.edu
<span class="put">Fri Jun 30 16:40:46 2000</span>
</pre>
<p>The format of the information returned by servers may vary, depending on the
server. Notice that the time zone may not be present.</p>
<p>If the server you choose does not support daytime, REBOL returns an
error:</p>
<pre>
print read daytime://www.example.com
<span class="put">connecting to: www.example.com
** Access Error: Cannot connect to www.example.com.
** Where: print read daytime://www.example.com</span>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-8">8. HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The world wide Web is driven by two fundamental technologies: HTTP and HTML.
HTTP is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol that controls how Web servers and Web
browsers communicate with each other. HTML is the Hypertext Markup Language that
defines the structure and contents of a Web page.</p>
<p>To retrieve a Web page, the browser sends a request to a Web server using
HTTP. On receiving the request, the server interprets it, sometimes using a CGI
script (see <A
href="#_Toc487519913">CGI -
Common Gateway Interface</A>), and sends back data. This data can be just about
anything, including HTML, text, images, programs, and sound.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-8.1">8.1 Reading a Web Page</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To read a Web page, use the <b><tt>read</tt></b> function with an HTTP URL.
For example:</p>
<pre>
page: read http://www.rebol.com
</pre>
<p>This returns the Web page for <tt>www</tt>.rebol.com. Note that a string
that contains the HTML code for the page is returned by the read. No graphics or
other information are fetched. To do so you would need to provide additional
reads. The page can be displayed as HTML code using <b><tt>print</tt></b>, it
can be written to a file with <b><tt>write</tt></b>, or it can be sent as
email using <b><tt>send</tt></b>.</p>
<pre>
print page

write %index.html page

send zaphod@example.com page
</pre>
<p>The page can be processed in a variety of ways by using a variety of REBOL
functions, such as <b><tt>parse</tt></b>, <b><tt>find</tt></b>, and
<b><tt>load</tt></b>.</p>
<p>For instance, to search a Web page for all occurrences of the word
<tt>REBOL</tt>, you can write:</p>
<pre>
parse read http://www.rebol.com [
    any [to "REBOL" copy line to newline (print line)]
]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-8.2">8.2 Scripts on Web Sites</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A Web server can provide more than just HTML scripts. Web servers are quite
useful for supplying REBOL scripts as well.</p>
<p>You can load REBOL scripts directly from a Web server with
<b><tt>load:</tt></b></p>
<pre>
data: load http://www.rebol.com/data.r
</pre>
<p>You can also evaluate scripts directly from a server with <b><tt>do:</tt></b></p>
<pre>
data: do http://www.rebol.com/code.r
</pre>
<div class="note"><p><b>Warning</b></p>
<p>Do this with care. Evaluating arbitrary scripts on open Internet
servers is asking for trouble. Evaluate a script only if you
completely trust its source, have fully inspected its source, or
have kept your REBOL security settings on maximum.</p>
</div>
<p>In addition, Web pages that contain HTML can contain embedded REBOL scripts,
and they can be run with:</p>
<pre>
data: do http://www.rebol.com/example.html
</pre>
<p>To determine if a script exists on a page before evaluating it, use the
<b><tt>script?</tt></b> function.</p>
<pre>
if page: script? http://www.rebol.com [do page]
</pre>
<p>The <b><tt>script?</tt></b> function reads the page from the Web site and
returns the page at its REBOL header position.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-8.3">8.3 Loading Markup Pages</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>HTML and XML pages can be quickly converted to a REBOL block with the
<b><tt>load/markup</tt></b> function. This function returns a block that
consists of all the tags and strings found within the page. All spacing and line
breaks are left intact.</p>
<p>To filter out all of the tags for a Web page and just print its text,
type:</p>
<pre>
tag-text: load/markup http://www.rebol.com
text: make string! 2000

foreach item tag-text [
    if string? item [append text item]
]

print text
</pre>
<p>You could then search this text for string patterns. It will contain all of
the spaces and line breaks of the original HTML file.</p>
<p>Here's another example that checks all links found on a Web page to make sure
that the pages they reference exist:</p>
<pre>
REBOL []

page: http://www.rebol.com/developer.html
set [path target] split-path page
system/options/quiet: true  ; turn off connection msgs
tag-text: load/markup page
links: make block! 100

foreach tag tag-text [  ; find all anchor href tags
    if tag? tag [
        if parse tag [
            "A" thru "HREF="
            [{"} copy link to {"} | copy link to "&gt;"]
            to end
        ][
            append links link
        ]
    ]
]

print links

foreach link unique links [  ; try each link
    if all [
        link/1 &lt;&gt; #"#"
        any [flag: not find link ":"
             find/match link "http:"]
    ][
        link: either flag [path/:link][to-url link]
        prin [link "... "]
        print either error? try [read link]
            ["failed"]["OK"]
    ]
]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-8.4">8.4 Other Functions</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To check if a Web page exists, use the <b><tt>exists?</tt></b> function,
which returns <tt>true</tt> if the page exists.</p>
<pre>
if exists? http://www.rebol.com [
    print "page still there"
]
</pre>
<p><I>Note: It is usually faster in many cases to just read the
page rather than checking first to see if it exists. Otherwise
the script must contact the server twice, and that can be time
consuming.</I></p>
<p>To request the date on which a Web page was last modified, use the
<b><tt>modified?</tt></b> function:</p>
<pre>
print modified? http://www.rebol.com/developer.html
</pre>
<p>However, note that not all Web servers provide modification date information.
Dynamically generated Web pages typically do not return a modification date.</p>
<p>Another way to determine if a Web page has changed is poll it every so often
and check it. A handy way to verify that a Web page has changed is by using the
<b><tt>checksum</tt></b> function. If the previously calculated checksum of a
Web page differs from its current value, then the Web page has been modified
since it was last checked. Here is an example that uses this technique. It
checks a page every eight hours.</p>
<pre>
forever [
    page: read http://www.rebol.com
    page-sum: checksum page
    if any [
        not exists? %page-sum
        page-sum &lt;&gt; (load %page-sum)
    ][
        print ["Page changed" now]
        save %page-sum page-sum
        send luke@rebol.com page
    ]
    wait 8:00
]
</pre>
<p>Whenever the page changes, it is sent to Luke via email.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-8.5">8.5 Acting Like a Browser</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Normally, REBOL identifies itself to a server when it reads from a Web site.
However, some servers are programmed to respond to particular browsers only. If
a request to a server does not produce the correct Web page, you can change the
request to make it look like it came from some other type of Web browser.
Pretending to be a Web browser is done by many programs to get Web sites to
respond correctly. However, this practice does end up defeating the purpose
behind the browser identification.</p>
<p>To change HTTP requests to look as though they are being sent by Netscape
4.0, you can modify the user-agent within the HTTP handler:</p>
<pre>
system/options/http/user-agent: "Mozilla/4.0"
</pre>
<p>Setting this variable affects all HTTP requests that follow.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-8.6">8.6 Posting CGI Requests</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>HTTP CGI requests can be posted in two ways. You can include the CGI request
data in the URL or you can provide the request data through an HTTP post
operation.</p>
<p>The URL CGI request uses a normal URL. The example below sends the CGI script
<tt>test</tt>.r the data value of 10.</p>
<pre>
read http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/test.r?data=10
</pre>
<p>The post CGI request requires that you supply the CGI data as part of a
custom refinement to the <b><tt>read</tt></b> function. The example below shows
how data is posted to CGI:</p>
<pre>
read/custom http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/test.r [
    post "data: 10"
]
</pre>
<p>In this example, the <b><tt>/custom</tt></b> refinement is used to provide
additional information to the read. The second argument is a block that begins
with the word <b><tt>post</tt></b> and is followed by the string to send.</p>
<p>The post method is useful for easily sending REBOL code and data to a web
server that runs CGI. The following example illustrates this:</p>
<pre>
data: [sell 10 shares of "ACME" at $123.45]

read/custom http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/test.r reduce [
    `post mold data
]
</pre>
<p>The mold function will produce the proper REBOL string to be sent to the
server.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-9">9. SMTP - Simple Mail Transport Protocol</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) controls the transfer of email
messages on the Internet. SMTP defines the interaction between Internet hosts
that participate in forwarding email from a sender to its destination.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-9.1">9.1 Sending Email</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Email is sent through SMTP by using the <b><tt>send</tt></b> function. This
function can send an email message to one or more email addresses.</p>
<p>For <b><tt>send</tt></b> to operate correctly, your networking must be set
up. The <b><tt>send</tt></b> function requires that you specify your email From
address and your default email server. See <A
href="#_Toc487519877">Initial Setup</A> above.</p>
<p>The <b><tt>send</tt></b> function takes two arguments: an email address and
a message. For example:</p>
<pre>
send user@example.com "Hi from REBOL"
</pre>
<p>The first argument must be an email or block data type. The second argument
can be any data type.</p>
<pre>
send luke@rebol.com $1000.00

send luke@rebol.com 10:30:40

send luke@rebol.com bill@ms.dom

send luke@rebol.com [Today 9-Apr-99 10:30]
</pre>
<p>Each of these simple email messages can be interpreted on the receiver's side
(with REBOL) or viewed with a normal email program.</p>
<p>You can send an entire file by reading the file and passing it as the second
argument to the send function:</p>
<pre>
send luke@rebol.com read %task.txt
</pre>
<p>Binary data, such as an image or executable file, can also be sent:</p>
<pre>
send luke@rebol.com read/binary %rebol
</pre>
<p>The binary data is encoded to allow it to be transferred as text.</p>
<p>To send a self-extracting binary message you can write:</p>
<pre>
send luke@rebol.com join "REBOL for the job" [
    newline "REBOL []" newline
    "write/binary %rebol decompress "
    compress read/binary %rebol
]
</pre>
<p>When the message is received, the file can be extracted by using the
<b><tt>do</tt></b> function.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-9.2">9.2 Multiple Recipients</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To send to multiple recipients, you can provide a block of email names:</p>
<pre>
send [luke@rebol.com ben@example.com] message
</pre>
<p>In this case, each message is individually addressed with only the
recipient's email name appearing in the <tt>To</tt> field (similar to BCC
addressing).</p>
<p>The block of email addresses can be any size or even a file that you load.
Just be sure that they are valid addresses, not strings. Strings are
ignored.</p>
<pre>
friends: [
    bob@cnn.dom
    betty@cnet.dom
    kirby@hooya.dom
    belle@apple.dom
    ...
]

send friends read %newsletter.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-9.3">9.3 Bulk Mail</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are sending email to a large group, you can reduce the load on your
server by delivering everyone in the group a single message. This is the purpose
of the <b><tt>/only</tt></b> refinement. It uses a feature of SMTP to send only
one message to multiple email addresses. Using the friends list from the
previous example:</p>
<pre>
send/only friends message
</pre>
<p>The messages are not individually addressed. You may have seen this mode in
some of the bulk email that you receive. When you receive bulk email, your
address does not appear in the <tt>To</tt> field.</p>
<p>The bulk email mode of SMTP should be used for email lists and
not for sending spam. Spam email is not proper network
etiquette, it is illegal in some countries and states, and spam
will get you banned from your ISP and from other sites.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-9.4">9.4 Subject Line and Headers</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>By default the <b><tt>send</tt></b> function uses the first line of a
message as the subject line. To provide your own subject line, you need to
supply an email header to the <b><tt>send</tt></b> function. In addition to a
subject line, you can provide an organization, date, CC, and even your own
custom fields.</p>
<p>To include a header, use the <b><tt>/header</tt></b> refinement of the
<b><tt>send</tt></b> function and include a header object. The header object
must be made from the <tt>system/standard/email</tt> object. For example:</p>
<pre>
header: make system/standard/email [
    Subject: "Seen REBOL yet?"
    Organization: "Freedom Fighters"
]
</pre>
<p>Notice that the standard fields, such as the <tt>From</tt> address, are not
required and are supplied automatically by the <b><tt>send</tt></b>
function.</p>
<p>The header is then provided as an argument to <b><tt>send/header:</tt></b></p>
<pre>
send/header friends message header
</pre>
<p>The email above is sent using the custom header for each message.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-9.5">9.5 Debug Your Scripts</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When testing email scripts, it is advised that you send email to yourself
first, before sending it to others. Examine your test email carefully to make
sure that it is what you want. It is common to have errors such as sending a
file name rather than the file contents. For instance, you might write:</p>
<pre>
send person %the-data-file.txt
</pre>
<p>This sends the name of the file, not the file itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-10">10. POP - Post Office Protocol</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Post Office Protocol (POP) allows you to fetch email that is waiting in a
mail server mailbox. POP defines a number of operations for how to access and
store email on your server.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-10.1">10.1 Reading Email</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You can read all of your email in a single line without removing it from the
email server: This is done by reading from a POP URL in which you provided your
username, password, and email host.</p>
<pre>
mail: read pop://user:pass@mail.example.com
</pre>
<p>The messages are returned as a block of strings which you can handle one
message at a time using code such as:</p>
<pre>
foreach message mail [print message]
</pre>
<p>To read individual email messages from the server, you need to open a port
connection to the server and handle each message one at a time. To open the POP
port:</p>
<pre>
mailbox: open pop://user:pass@mail.example.com
</pre>
<p>In the example, <tt>mailbox</tt> can be accessed as a series. It
responds to many of the standard series functions, such as
<b><tt>length?</tt></b>, <b><tt>first</tt></b>, <b><tt>second</tt></b>, <b><tt>third</tt></b>, <b><tt>pick</tt></b>, <b><tt>next</tt></b>,
<b><tt>back</tt></b>, <b><tt>head</tt></b>, <b><tt>tail</tt></b>, <b><tt>head?</tt></b>, <b><tt>tail?</tt></b>, <b><tt>remove</tt></b>, and
<b><tt>clear</tt></b>.</p>
<p>To determine the number of mail messages residing on the server, use the
<b><tt>length?</tt></b> function.</p>
<pre>
print length? mailbox
<span class="put">37</span>
</pre>
<p>In addition, you can find out the total size of all messages and the
individual sizes of messages with:</p>
<pre>
print mailbox/locals/total-size

print mailbox/locals/sizes
</pre>
<p>To display the first, second, and last messages, you can write:</p>
<pre>
print first mailbox

print second mailbox

print last mailbox
</pre>
<p>You can also use <b><tt>pick</tt></b> to fetch a specific message:</p>
<pre>
print pick mailbox 27
</pre>
<p>You can fetch and display each message from the oldest to the newest using a
loop that is identical to that used for other types of series:</p>
<pre>
while [not tail? mailbox] [
    print first mailbox
    mailbox: next mailbox
]
</pre>
<p>You can also read your email from newest to oldest with a loop such as:</p>
<pre>
mailbox: tail mailbox

while [not head? mailbox] [
    mailbox: back mailbox
    print first mailbox
]
</pre>
<p>When you are done, be sure to <b><tt>close</tt></b> the mailbox. This can be
done with a line such as:</p>
<pre>
close mailbox
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-10.2">10.2 Removing Email</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>As with series, the <b><tt>remove</tt></b> function can be used to delete a
single message, and the <b><tt>clear</tt></b> function can be used to delete
all of the messages from the current position to the end of the mailbox.</p>
<p>For example, to read a message, save it to a file, and remove it from the
server:</p>
<pre>
mailbox: open pop://user:pass@mail.example.com
write %mail.txt first mailbox
remove mailbox
close mailbox
</pre>
<p>The message is removed from the server when the <b><tt>close</tt></b> is
done.</p>
<p>To remove the 22nd email message from the server, you can write:</p>
<pre>
user:pass@mail.example.com
remove at mailbox 22
close mailbox
</pre>
<p>You can remove a number of messages by using the <b><tt>/part</tt></b>
refinement with the remove function:</p>
<pre>
remove/part mailbox 5
</pre>
<p>To remove all of the messages in your mailbox, use the <b><tt>clear</tt></b>
function:</p>
<pre>
mailbox: open pop://user:pass@example.com
clear mailbox
close mailbox
</pre>
<p>The <b><tt>clear</tt></b> function can also be used at different positions
within the mailbox to remove messages to the end of the mailbox.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-10.3">10.3 Handling Email Headers</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Email messages always include a header. The header holds information such as
the sender, recipient, subject, date, and other fields.</p>
<p>In REBOL email headers are handled as objects that contain all of the
necessary fields. To convert email message to a header object you can use the
<b><tt>import-email</tt></b> function. For example:</p>
<pre>
msg: import-email first mailbox

print first msg/from  ; the email address
print msg/date
print msg/subject
print msg/content
</pre>
<p>You can easily write a filter that scans your email for messages that begin
with a particular subject line:</p>
<pre>
mailbox: open pop://user:pass@example.com

while [not tail? mailbox] [
    msg: import-email first mailbox
    if find/match msg/subject "[REBOL]" [
        print msg/subject
    ]
    mailbox: next mailbox
]

close mailbox
</pre>
<p>Here is another example that informs you when email is received from a group
of friends:</p>
<pre>
friends: [orson@rebol.com hans@rebol.com]

messages: read pop://user:pass@example.com

foreach message messages [
    msg: import-email message
    if find friends first msg/from [
        print [msg/from newline msg/content]
        send first msg/from "Got your email!"
    ]
]
</pre>
<p>This spam filter removes all messages from the server that do not contain
your email name anywhere within the message:</p>
<pre>
mailbox: open pop://user:pass@example.com

while [not tail? mailbox] [
    mailbox: either find first mailbox user@example.com
        [next mailbox][remove mailbox]
]

close mailbox
</pre>
<p>Here is a simple email list server that receives messages and sends them to a
group. The server only accepts email from people in the group.</p>
<pre>
group: [orson@rebol.com hans@rebol.com]

mailbox: open pop://user:pass@example.com

while [not tail? mailbox] [
    message: import-email first mailbox
    mailbox: either find group first message/from [
        send/only group first mailbox
        remove mailbox
    ][next mailbox]
]

close mailbox

<h2 id="section-11">11. FTP - File Transfer Protocol</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is used widely on the Internet for
transferring files to and from a remote host. FTP is commonly used for uploading
pages to a Web site and for providing online file archives.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-11.1">11.1 Using FTP</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In REBOL FTP file operations are handled in much the same way as local file
operations. Functions such as <b><tt>read</tt></b>, <b><tt>write</tt></b>,
<b><tt>load</tt></b>, <b><tt>save</tt></b>, <b><tt>do</tt></b>,
<b><tt>open</tt></b>, <b><tt>close</tt></b>, <b><tt>exists?</tt></b>,
<b><tt>size?</tt></b>, <b><tt>modified?</tt></b>, and others are used with
FTP. REBOL distinguishes between local files and files accessible by FTP through
the use of an FTP URL.</p>
<p>Access to FTP servers can be open or closed. Open access allows anyone to
login to the site and download files. This is called anonymous access and it is
used frequently for public file archives. Closed access requires that you
provide a username and password to download and upload files. This is the mode
of operation for uploading Web pages to a Web site.</p>
<p>Although FTP does not require your REBOL networking to be
configured, if you  wish to use anonymous access, an email
address is required. This address is found in the
<tt>system/user/email</tt> object. Normally, when you boot REBOL,
this field is set from your <tt>user</tt>.r file. See <A
href="#_Toc487519877">Initial Setup</A> for more detail.</p>
<p>If you are using FTP through a proxy server or firewall, FTP may need to
operate in passive mode. Passive mode does not require reverse connections from
the FTP server to the client for data transfers. This mode only makes outgoing
connections from your machine and allows a greater level of security. To enable
passive mode you need to set a flag in the FTP protocol handler:</p>
<pre>
system/schemes/ftp/passive: true
</pre>
<p>If you do not know if it is necessary, try FTP first without it. If that does
not work, try setting the passive flag.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-11.2">11.2 FTP URLs</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>An FTP URL has the basic form:</p>
<pre>
ftp://user:pass@host/directory/file
</pre>
<p>For anonymous access the username and password can be left out:</p>
<pre>
ftp://host/directory/file
</pre>
<p>Most of the examples in this section use this form for simplicity; however,
they also work with a username and password.</p>
<p>To access a remote directory, end the URL with a slash, such as:</p>
<pre>
ftp://user:pass@host/directory/

ftp://host/directory/

ftp://host/
</pre>
<p>More about directory access is shown below.</p>
<p>It is convenient to put the URL in a variable and use paths to provide the
file names. This allows you to refer to the URL with just a word. For
example:</p>
<pre>
site: ftp://ftp.rebol.com/pub/

read site/readme.txt
</pre>
<p>This technique is used in some of the sections that follow.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-11.3">11.3 Transferring Text Files</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>FTP distinguishes between text files and binary files. When transferring text
files, FTP converts the line break characters. This is not desirable for binary
files.</p>
<p>To read a text file, supply the <b><tt>read</tt></b> function with an FTP
URL:</p>
<pre>
file: read ftp://ftp.site.com/file.r
</pre>
<p>This puts the contents of the file into a string. To write the file locally,
use this line:</p>
<pre>
write %file.r read ftp://ftp.site.com/file.r
</pre>
<p>Many of the refinements of <b><tt>read</tt></b> can also be used. For
instance, you can use <b><tt>read/lines</tt></b> with:</p>
<pre>
data: read/lines ftp://ftp.site.com/file.r
</pre>
<p>This example returns a block of lines for the file. See the <A
href="rebolcore-12.html#_Toc487519750">Files</A>
chapter for more information about the refinements to the <b><tt>read</tt></b>
function.</p>
<p>To write a text file to the server, use the <b><tt>write</tt></b>
function:</p>
<pre>
write ftp://ftp.site.com/file.r read %file.r
</pre>
<p>The <b><tt>write</tt></b> function can also include refinements. See the <A
href="rebolcore-12.html#_Toc487519750">Files</A>
chapter.</p>
<p>As with normal text file transfers, all line termination will be properly
converted during FTP transfers.</p>
<p>Here is a simple script that updates files to your Web site:</p>
<pre>
site: ftp://wwwuser:secret@www.site.dom/pages

files: [%index.html %home.html %info.html]

foreach file files [write site/:file read file]
</pre>
<p>This should not be used for transferring graphics or sound files, as they are
binary. Use the technique shown in <A href="#28819">Transferring
Binary Files</A>.</p>
<p>In addition to the <b><tt>read</tt></b> and <b><tt>write</tt></b>
functions, you can use the <b><tt>load</tt></b>, <b><tt>save</tt></b>, and
<b><tt>do</tt></b> functions with FTP.</p>
<pre>
data: load ftp://ftp.site.com/database.r

save ftp://ftp.site.com/data.r data-block

do ftp://ftp.site.com/scripts/test.r
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-11.4">11.4 Transferring Binary Files</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To avoid the line termination conversion when transferring binary files
(images, archives, executable files), use the <b><tt>/binary</tt></b>
refinement. For instance, to read a binary file from an FTP server:</p>
<pre>
data: read/binary ftp://ftp.site.com/file
</pre>
<p>To make a local copy of the file:</p>
<pre>
write/binary %file read/binary ftp://ftp.site.com/file
</pre>
<p>To write a binary file to a server:</p>
<pre>
write/binary ftp://ftp.site.com/file read/binary %file
</pre>
<p>No line termination conversions are performed.</p>
<p>To transfer a set of graphics files to a Web site, use this script:</p>
<pre>
site: ftp://user:pass@ftp.site.com/www/graphics

files: [%icon.gif %logo.gif %photo.jpg]

foreach file files [
    write/binary site/:file read/binary file
]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-11.5">11.5 Appending to Files</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>FTP also allows you to append text and data to an existing file. To do so,
use the <b><tt>write/append</tt></b> refinement as described in the <A
href="rebolcore-12.html#_Toc487519750">Files</A>
chapter.</p>
<pre>
write/append ftp://ftp.site.com/pub/log.txt reform
    ["Log entry date:" now newline]
</pre>
<p>This can also be used with binary files.</p>
<pre>
write/binary/append ftp://ftp.site.com/pub/log.txt
    read/binary %datafile
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-11.6">11.6 Reading Directories</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To read the file names of an FTP directory, follow the directory name with a
forward slash:</p>
<pre>
print read ftp://ftp.site.com/

pub-files: read ftp://ftp.site.com/pub/
</pre>
<p>The ending forward slash (/) indicates that this is a directory access not a
file access. The forward slash is not always required, but it is recommended
when you know you are accessing a directory.</p>
<p>The block of files that is returned includes all of the files in the
directory. Within that block, directory names are indicated with a forward slash
following their names. For example:</p>
<pre>
foreach file read ftp://ftp.site.com/pub/ [
    print file
]
<span class="put">readme.txt
rebol.r
rebol.exe
library/docs/</span>
</pre>
<p>You can also use the <b><tt>dir?</tt></b> function on a file to determine if
it is a directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-11.7">11.7 File Information</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The same functions that provide information about files also
provide information about FTP files. This includes the
<b><tt>modified?</tt></b>, <b><tt>size?</tt></b>, <b><tt>exists?</tt></b>, <b><tt>dir?</tt></b>, and <b><tt>info?</tt></b>
functions.</p>
<p>You can use the <b><tt>exists?</tt></b> function to determine if a file
exists:</p>
<pre>
if exists? ftp://ftp.site.com/pub/log.txt [
    print "Log file is there"
]
</pre>
<p>This works for directories too, but include the forward slash at the end of
the directory name:</p>
<pre>
if exists? ftp://ftp.site.com/pub/rebol/ [
    print read ftp://ftp.site.com/pub/rebol/
]
</pre>
<p>To get the size or modification date for a file:</p>
<pre>
print size? ftp://ftp.site.com/pub/log.txt

print modified? ftp://ftp.site.com/pub/log.txt
</pre>
<p>To determine if the file is actually a directory:</p>
<pre>
if dir? ftp://ftp.site.com/pub/text [
    print "It's a directory"
]
</pre>
<p>You can obtain all this information in a single access by using the
<b><tt>info?</tt></b> function:</p>
<pre>
file-info: info? ftp://ftp.site.com/pub/log.txt

probe file-info

print file-info/size
</pre>
<p>To perform the same operation on a directory:</p>
<pre>
probe info? ftp://ftp.site.com/pub/
</pre>
<p>To print a directory listing:</p>
<pre>
files: open ftp://ftp.site.com/pub/

forall files [
    file: first files
    info: info? file
    print [file info/date info/size info/type]
]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-11.8">11.8 Making Directories</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>New FTP directories can be created with the <b><tt>make-dir</tt></b>
function:</p>
<pre>
make-dir ftp://user:pass@ftp.site.com/newdir/
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-11.9">11.9 Deleting Files</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>With appropriate permission settings, files can be deleted from a remote FTP
server by using the <b><tt>delete</tt></b> function:</p>
<pre>
delete ftp://user:pass@ftp.site.com/upload.txt
</pre>
<p>You can also delete directories:</p>
<pre>
delete ftp://user:pass@ftp.site.com/newdir/
</pre>
<p>Note that a directory must be empty for this to succeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-11.10">11.10 Renaming Files</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You can <b><tt>rename</tt></b> a file with the line:</p>
<pre>
rename ftp://user:pass@ftp.site.com/foo.r %bar.r
</pre>
<p>The new name for the file will be <tt>bar</tt>.r.</p>
<p>FTP also allows you to move a file to a different directory with:</p>
<pre>
rename ftp://user:pass@ftp.site.com/foo.r %pub/bar.r
</pre>
<p>To rename a directory on an FTP site be sure to follow the directory name
with a slash:</p>
<pre>
rename ftp://user:pass@ftp.site.com/rebol/ rebol-old/
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-11.11">11.11 About Passwords</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The above examples include the password within their URLs, but if you plan on
sharing your script, you probably don't want that information to be known.
Here's a simple way to prompt for a password and build the correct URL:</p>
<pre>
pass: ask "Password? "

data: read join ftp://user: [pass "@ftp.site.com/file"]
</pre>
<p>Or, you can ask for both the username and password:</p>
<pre>
user: ask "Username? "
pass: ask "Password? "
data: read join ftp:// [
    user ":" pass "@ftp.site.com/file"
]
</pre>
<p>You can also open FTP connections by using a port specification rather than a
URL. This allows you to use any password, even ones containing special
characters that are not easily written in URLs. An example of a port
specification to open an FTP connection is:</p>
<pre>
ftp-port: open [
    scheme: `ftp
    host: "ftp.site.com"
    user: ask "Username? "
    pass: ask "Password? "
]
</pre>
<p>See <A href="#40832">Specifying Network Resources</A> above for more detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-11.12">11.12 Transferring Large Files</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Transferring large files requires special considerations. You may want to
transfer the file in chunks to reduce the memory required by your computer and
to provide user feedback while the transfer is happening.</p>
<p>Here is an example that downloads a very large binary file in chunks.</p>
<pre>
inp: open/binary/direct ftp://ftp.site.com/big-file.bmp
out: open/binary/new/direct %big-file.bmp
buf-size: 200000
buffer: make binary! buf-size + 2

while [not zero? size: read-io inp buffer buf-size][
    write-io out buffer size
    total: total + size
    print ["transferred:" total]
]
</pre>
<p>Be sure to use the <b><tt>/direct</tt></b> refinement, otherwise the entire
file will be buffered internally by REBOL. The <b><tt>read-io</tt></b> and
<b><tt>write-io</tt></b> functions allow reuse of the buffer memory that has
already allocated. Other functions such as <b><tt>copy</tt></b> would allocate
additional memory.</p>
<p>If the transfer fails, you can restart FTP from where it left off. To do so,
examine the output file or the size variable to determine where to restart the
transfer. Open the file again with a custom refinement that specifies
<b><tt>restart</tt></b> and the location from which to start the read. Here is
an example of the <b><tt>open</tt></b> function to use when the <tt>total</tt>
variable indicates the length already read:</p>
<pre>
inp: open/binary/direct/custom
    ftp://ftp.site.com/big-file.bmp
    reduce ['restart total]
</pre>
<p>You should note that restart only works for binary transfers. It cannot be
used with text transfers because the line terminator conversion that takes place
will cause incorrect offsets.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-12">12. NNTP - Network News Transfer Protocol</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is the basis for tens of thousands
of newsgroups that provide a public forum for millions of Internet users. REBOL
includes two levels of support for NNTP.</p>
<p>The built-in support for NNTP that provides very limited functionality and
access. This is the NTTP scheme.</p>
<p>An extended level of functionality that is provided by the news scheme that
is implemented in the file distributed as <tt>nntp</tt>.r.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-12.1">12.1 Reading the Newsgroup List</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>NNTP consists of two components: a list of newsgroups supported by a specific
newsgroup server (newsgroups are typically selected by an Internet service
provider); and, a database of messages that are currently available for any
particular newsgroup.</p>
<p>To retrieve the list of all newsgroups from a specific news server, use the
<b><tt>read</tt></b> function with an NNTP URL such as:</p>
<pre>
groups: read nntp://news.example.com
</pre>
<p>This may take a while, depending on your connection; there are thousands of
newsgroups.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-12.2">12.2 Reading All Messages</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are using a fast connection, you can read all of the pending messages
for a newsgroup with:</p>
<pre>
messages: read nntp://news.example.com/alt.test
</pre>
<p>However, caution is advised. Some newsgroups can have thousands of messages.
It can take a long time to download all the messages, and you may run out of
memory to hold them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-12.3">12.3 Reading Single Messages</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To read single messages, open NNTP as a port and use series functions to
access messages. This is similar to how you read email from a POP port. For
example:</p>
<pre>
group: open nntp://news.example.com/alt.test
</pre>
<p>You can use the <b><tt>length?</tt></b> function to determine the number of
messages that are available in the newsgroup:</p>
<pre>
print length? group
</pre>
<p>To read the first message available in the newsgroup, use
<b><tt>first:</tt></b></p>
<pre>
message: first group
</pre>
<p>To select a specific message in the group by index, use
<b><tt>pick:</tt></b></p>
<pre>
message: pick group 37
</pre>
<p><A name=_Toc487519909></A>To create a simple loop that scans all messages for
a keyword, use:</p>
<pre>
forall group [
    if find msg: first first group "REBOL" [
        print msg
    ]
]
</pre>
<p>Remember that when the loop returns, the group series is positioned to the
tail. If you need to return to the head of the group:</p>
<pre>
group: head group
</pre>
<p>Be sure to <b><tt>close</tt></b> a port once you are done using it:</p>
<pre>
close group
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-12.4">12.4 Handling News Headers</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>News messages always include a header. The header holds information such as
the sender, summary, keywords, subject, date, and other fields.</p>
<p>Headers are handled as objects. To convert a news message to a news header
object you can use the <b><tt>import-email</tt></b> function. For example:</p>
<pre>
message: first first group
header: import-email message
</pre>
<p>You can now access the fields of the news message:</p>
<pre>
print [header/from header/subject header/date]
</pre>
<p>Different newsgroups and newsgroup clients use different fields in their
header. To view the fields available for a specific message display the first
item of the header object:</p>
<pre>
print first header
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-12.5">12.5 Sending a News Message</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Before you can send a news message, you need to create a header for it. Here
is a generic header that can be used for news:</p>
<pre>
news-header: make object! [
    Path: "not-for-mail"
    Sender: Reply-to: From: system/user/email
    Subject: "Test message"
    Newsgroups: "alt.test"
    Message-ID: none
    Organization: "Docs For All"
    Keywords: "Test"
    Summary: "A test message"
]
</pre>
<p>Before you can send it, you need to create a unique global identification
number for it. Here is a function that does that:</p>
<pre>
make-id: does [
    rejoin [
        "&lt;"
        system/user/email/user
        "."
        checksum form now
        "."
        random 999999
        "@"
        read dns://
        "&gt;"
    ]
]

print news-header/message-id: make-id
<span class="put">&lt;carl.4959961.534798@fred.example.com&gt;</span>
</pre>
<p>Now you can combine the header with the message. They must be separated by at
least one blank line. The content of the message is read from a file.</p>
<pre>
write nntp://news.example.net/alt.test rejoin [
    net-utils/export news-header
    newline newline
    read %message.txt
    newline
]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-13">13. CGI - Common Gateway Interface</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The common gateway interface is used with many Web servers to provide
processing beyond the normal HTTP Web interface. CGI requests are submitted from
Web browsers to Web servers. When a server receives a CGI request, it typically
executes a script to process the request and return a result to the browser.
These CGI scripts can be written in a variety of languages, and REBOL provides
one of the easier ways of handling CGI.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-13.1">13.1 CGI Server Setup</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Setting up CGI access is different for every Web server. See the instructions
provided with your server.</p>
<p>Typically a server has an option for enabling CGI operation. You need to
enable this option and provide a path to the directory where your CGI scripts
reside. A common directory for CGI scripts is in <tt>cgi-bin</tt>.</p>
<p>On Apache servers, the <tt>ExecCGI</tt> option enables CGI scripts, and you
can provide a directory (<tt>cgi-bin</tt> ) for your scripts. This is normally
set up by default installation of Apache.</p>
<p>To configure CGI for Microsoft IIS, go to the <tt>properties</tt> for
cgi-bin and click on the <tt>configuration</tt> button. On the
configuration panel click <tt>add</tt> and enter the path to your
<tt>rebol</tt>.exe file. The format for this is:</p>
<pre>
C:\rebol\rebol.exe -cs %s %s
</pre>
<p>The two <tt>%s</tt> symbols are required for correctly passing the script and
command line arguments to REBOL. Add the extension for REBOL files (<tt></tt>.r
) and set the last field to <tt>PUT</tt>, <tt>DELETE</tt>. The script engine
does not need to be selected.</p>
<p>The -<tt>cs</tt> option that is provided to REBOL enables CGI operation and
allows the script to access all files. (!!See notes below on how scripts can
limit file access to selected directories).</p>
<p>With Web servers other than those described above, the server requires
configuration to execute the REBOL executable for <tt></tt>.r extension files
and run REBOL with the required option <tt>-cs</tt>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-13.2">13.2 CGI Scripts</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Before a script can be executed on most CGI servers, it needs to have the
correct file permissions. On UNIX-type systems or those that use the Apache
server you need to change the permissions to enable the script to be readable
and executable by all users. This can be done with the <b><tt>chmod</tt></b>
function. If you are new to this concept, you should read your operating system
manual or talk with your system administrator before changing file
permissions.</p>
<p>For Apache and various other Web servers to run REBOL scripts, you need to
provide the correct header at the top of each script file. The header specifies
the path to the REBOL executable file and the <tt>-cs</tt> option. This can be
followed by the normal REBOL script header. Here is a simple CGI script that
prints the string, <tt>hello!</tt>.</p>
<pre>
#!/path/to/rebol -cs

REBOL [Title: "CGI Test Script"]

print "Content-Type: text/plain"

print ""  ; required

print "Hello!"
</pre>
<p>There are many things that prevent a CGI script from running correctly. Get
this simple script working first before you try more complex scripts. If your
script does not work, here are a few items to check:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have CGI enabled on your Web server.</li>
<li>The first line begins with a <C>#! and the correct path to REBOL.</li>
<li>The -<C>cs option is supplied to REBOL.</li>
<li>The script begins with "Content-Type:" being printed. (!!see below)</li>
<li>The script is in the correct directory. (normally the <C>cgi-bin
directory)</li>
<li>The script has the correct file permissions (readable and executable by
all).</li>
<li>The script contains the correct line break characters. Some servers do not
run scripts that contain the CR character for line breaks. You may need to
convert the file. (Use REBOL to do this in one line: write file, read file).</li>
<li>The script does not contain errors. Test it without CGI to make sure that the
script loads (does not have syntax errors) and functions properly. Provide some
sample data and test it.</li>
<li>All files that are accessed by the script have the correct file
permissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Often one or more of the above items is wrong and prevent your script from
running. You may see an error when viewing the Web page. If it says "Server
Error" or "CGI Error" then it is typically something to do with the permissions
or setup of the script. If it shows a REBOL error message, then the script is
running, but you have an error within the script.</p>
<p>In the example script shown above, the <tt>Content-Type</tt> line is
critical. It is part of the HTTP header that is returned to the browser, and it
tells the browser the type of content being delivered. This is followed by a
blank line to separate it from the actual content.</p>
<p>Many different types of content can be delivered. The previous example was
plain text, but you can also deliver HTML as is shown in the next example. (See
your Web server manual for more information about content types.)</p>
<p>The content type and blank line can be combined into a single line. The caret
forward slash <tt>(^/</tt>) symbol provides an additional line break to separate
it from the content.</p>
<pre>
print "Content-Type: text/plain^/"
</pre>
<p>It is a good practice to always print this line immediately from your script.
This allows error messages to be seen by the browser if your script encounters
an error.</p>
<p>Here is a simple CGI script that prints the time:</p>
<pre>
#!/path/to/rebol -cs

REBOL [Title: "Time Script"]

print "Content-Type: text/plain^/"

print ["The time is now" now/time]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-13.3">13.3 Generating HTML Content</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There are as many ways to create HTML content as there are ways to create
strings. This page creates a page that displays a page hit counter:</p>
<pre>
#!/path/to/rebol -cs

REBOL [Title: "HTML Example"]

print "Content-Type: text/html^/"

count: either exists? %counter [load %counter][0]
save %counter count: count + 1

print [
    {&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;H2&gt;Web Counter Page&lt;/H2&gt;
    You are visitor} count {to this page!&lt;P&gt;
    &lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;}
]
</pre>
<p>The script in the example above loads and saves to a counter text file. For
this file to be accessible, it will require the appropriate permissions be set
to allow access by all users.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-13.4">13.4 CGI Environment</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>When a CGI script is run the server provides information to REBOL about the
CGI request and its arguments. All of this information is provided as an object
within the <tt>system/options</tt> object. To view the fields of the object,
type:</p>
<pre>
probe system/options/cgi
<span class="put">make object! [
    server-software: none
    server-name: none
    gateway-interface: none
    server-protocol: none
    server-port: none
    request-method: none
    path-info: none
    path-translated: none
    script-name: none
    query-string: none
    remote-host: none
    remote-addr: none
    auth-type: none
    remote-user: none
    remote-ident: none
    Content-Type: none
    content-length: none
    other-headers: []
]</span>
</pre>
<p>Of course, your script will ignore most of this information, but some of it
could be of use. For instance, you may want to create a log file that records
the network address of the system that made the request, or check the type of
browser being used.</p>
<p>To generate a CGI page that displays this content in your browser:</p>
<pre>
#!/path/to/rebol -cs

REBOL [Title: "Dump CGI Server Variables"]

print "Content-Type: text/plain^/"

print "Server Variables:"

probe system/options/cgi
</pre>
<p>If you want to use this information in a log, you can write it to a file. For
example, to log the addresses of visitors to your CGI page you could write:</p>
<pre>
write/append/lines %cgi.log
    system/options/cgi/remote-addr
</pre>
<p>The <b><tt>/append</tt></b> and <b><tt>/lines</tt></b> refinements causes
the write to be at the tail of the file and include a line-break. Here's another
approach that puts multiple items on the same line:</p>
<pre>
write/append %cgi.log reform [
    system/options/cgi/remote-addr
    system/options/cgi/remote-ident
    system/options/cgi/content-type
    newline
]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-13.5">13.5 CGI Requests</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two methods for CGI to provide request data to your scripts: GET
and POST.</p>
<p>The GET method encodes CGI data into the URL. This is used to provide
information to the server. You may have noticed before that some URLs look like
this:</p>
<pre>
http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/test.r?&amp;data=test
</pre>
<p>The string that follows the question mark (?) provides the arguments to CGI.
At times they can be quite long. This string is provided to your script when it
is run. It can be obtained from the <tt>cgi/query-string</tt> field. For
instance, to print the string from a script:</p>
<pre>
print system/options/cgi/query-string
</pre>
<p>The data within the string can include whatever data you require. However,
because the string is part of a URL, data must be encoded. There are
restrictions on the characters that are allowed.</p>
<p>In addition, when the data is created by HTML forms, it is encoded in a
standard way. This data can be decoded and placed within an object with the
code:</p>
<pre>
cgi: make object! decode-cgi-query
    system/options/cgi/query-string
</pre>
<p>The <tt>decode-cgi-query</tt> function returns a block that contains variable
names and their values. See the HTML form example in the next section.</p>
<p>The POST method provides the CGI data as a string. The data does not need to
be encoded. It can be in any format you desire and can even be binary. Post data
is read from the standard input device. You will need to read it from the input
with a line such as:</p>
<pre>
data: make string! 2002
read-io system/ports/input data 2000
</pre>
<p>This would read up to the first 2000 bytes of POST data and put it in a
string.</p>
<p>A good format for POST data is to use a REBOL dialect and create a simple
parser. The POST data can be loaded and parsed as a block. See the <A
href="rebolcore-15.html#_Toc487519750">Parsing</A>
chapter.</p>
<div class="note"><p><b>Warning About Blocks</b></p>
<p>It is not a good idea to pass REBOL blocks to be directly
evaluated because this can present a security risk. For
instance, someone could POST a block that reads or deletes files
on the server. However, it is safe to pass blocks that are
interpreted by your script (a dialect).</p>
</div>
<p>Here is an example script that displays the post data in your browser:</p>
<pre>
#!/path/to/rebol -cs

REBOL [Title: "Show POST data"]

print "Content-Type: text/html^/"
data: make string! 10000
foreach line copy system/ports/input [
    repend data [line newline]
]

print [
    &lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;
    {Here is the posted data.}
    &lt;HR&gt;&lt;PRE&gt;data&lt;/PRE&gt;
    &lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-13.6">13.6 Processing HTML Forms</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>CGI is often used for processing HTML forms. The forms accept input from
various fields and submit them to the Web server as an HTML get or post
method.</p>
<p>Here is an example that uses the CGI get to process a form and send an email
as the result. There are two parts to this: the HTML page and the CGI
script.</p>
<p>Here is an HTML page that includes a form:</p>
<pre>
&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;

&lt;FORM ACTION="http://example.com/cgi-bin/send.r" METHOD="GET"&gt;

&lt;H1&gt;CGI Emailer&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;HR&gt;

Enter your email address:&lt;P&gt;

&lt;INPUT TYPE="TEXT" NAME="email" SIZE="30"&gt;&lt;P&gt;

&lt;TEXTAREA NAME="message" ROWS="7" COLS="35"&gt;
Enter message here.
&lt;/TEXTAREA&gt;&lt;P&gt;

&lt;INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT" VALUE="Submit"&gt;

&lt;/FORM&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>
<p>When the above script is submitted, it needs a CGI script to handle its
results. Here is an example of such a script. This example script decodes the
form data and sends the email. It returns a confirmation page.</p>
<pre>
#!/path/to/rebol -cs

REBOL [Title: "Send CGI Email"]

print "Content-Type: text/html^/"

cgi: make object! decode-cgi-query
    system/options/cgi/query-string

print {&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;H1&gt;Email Status&lt;/H1&gt;&lt;HR&gt;&lt;P&gt;}

failed: error? try [send to-email cgi/email cgi/message]

print either failed [
    {The email could not be sent.}
][
    [{The email to} cgi/email {was sent.}]
]

print {&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;HTML&gt;}
</pre>
<p>This script should be named <tt>send</tt>.r and stored in the
<tt>cgi-bin</tt> directory. It's permissions must be set to being readable and
executable by all.</p>
<p>When the form has been submitted by a browser, this script will run. It
decodes the CGI query string into a cgi object. The object now has email and
message variables that are used for the <b><tt>send</tt></b> function. Before
<b><tt>send</tt></b> is done, the email field is converted from a string to an
<tt>email</tt> datatype.</p>
<p>The <b><tt>send</tt></b> function is placed within a try block to catch
errors if they occur while sending the email. The failed variable is set to true
if an error occurred, and the appropriate message is generated.</p>
<p>Other CGI examples can be found in the REBOL Script Library at <tt></tt>
<A href="http://www.rebol.com/library/library.html">http://www.rebol.com/library/library.html</A>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-14">14. TCP - Transmission Control Protocol</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to those protocols previously described, you can create your own
network servers and clients with the transmission control protocol, TCP.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-14.1">14.1 Creating Clients</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>TCP ports can be opened in the same way as other REBOL protocols, using the
TCP URL. To open a TCP connection to an HTTP (Web) server on TCP port number
80:</p>
<pre>
http-port: open tcp://www.example.com:80
</pre>
<p>Another way of opening a TCP connection is to provide the port specification
directly. This is a substitute for using a URL and is often quite useful:</p>
<pre>
http-port: open [
    scheme: 'tcp
    host: "www.example.com"
    port-id: 80
]
</pre>
<p>Since ports are series, you can use the same series functions for sending and
receiving data. The example below queries the HTTP server opened in the previous
example. It uses the <b><tt>insert</tt></b> function to put data into the port
series which sends it to the server:</p>
<pre>
insert http-port "GET / HTTP/1.0^/^/"
</pre>
<p>The two newline characters are used to tell the server that the header has
been sent.</p>
<p><I>The newline characters are automatically converted to CR LF
sequences because the port was opened in text mode. </I></p>
<p>The<b><tt></tt></b> server processes the HTTP request and returns a result to
the port series. To read the result, use the <b><tt>copy</tt></b> function:</p>
<pre>
while [data: copy http-port] [prin data]
</pre>
<p>This loop will continue to fetch data until a <tt>none</tt> is returned from
copy. This behavior differs between protocols. A none is returned because the
server closes the connection. Other protocols may send a special character to
indicate the end of the transfer.</p>
<p>Now that all the data has been received, HTTP port should be closed:</p>
<pre>
close http-port
</pre>
<p>Here is another example that connects to a POP port on a server:</p>
<pre>
pop: open/lines tcp://fred.example.com:110
</pre>
<p>This example uses the <b><tt>/lines</tt></b> refinement. The connection will
now be line oriented. Data will be written and read as lines. To read the first
line from the server:</p>
<pre>
print first pop
<span class="put">+OK QPOP (version 2.53) at fred.example.com starting.</span>
</pre>
<p>To send the server a username for POP login:</p>
<pre>
insert pop "user carl"
</pre>
<p>Because the port is operating in line mode, a line terminator is sent after
the insert. The server response can be read with with:</p>
<pre>
print first pop
<span class="put">+OK Password required for carl.</span>
</pre>
<p>And the rest of the communication would proceed as:</p>
<pre>
insert pop "pass secret"

print first pop
<span class="put">+OK carl has 0 messages (0 octets).</span>
insert pop "quit"

first pop
<span class="put">+OK Pop server at fred.example.com signing off.</span>
</pre>
<p>The connection should now be closed:</p>
<pre>
close pop
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-14.2">14.2 Creating Servers</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To create a server you need to wait for connections and respond to them as
they occur. To set up a port on your machine that can be used to wait for
incoming connections:</p>
<pre>
listen: open tcp://:8001
</pre>
<p>Notice that you do not supply a host name, only a port number. This type of
port is called a <tt>listen</tt> port. The system now accepts
connections on port number 8001.</p>
<p>To wait for a connection from another machine, you <b><tt>wait</tt></b> on
the listen port.</p>
<pre>
wait listen
</pre>
<p>This function does not return until a connection has been made.</p>
<p><I>NOTE:  There are other options available for <b><tt>wait</tt></b> . For
instance, you can wait on multiple ports or for a timeout as
well.</I></p>
<p>You can now open the connection port from the machine that has contacted your
system:</p>
<pre>
connection: first listen
</pre>
<p>This returns the connection that has been made to the listen port. It is a
port like all others and can now be used to receive and send data using the
<b><tt>insert</tt></b>, <b><tt>copy</tt></b>, <b><tt>first</tt></b>, and
other series functions:</p>
<pre>
insert connection "you are connected^/"

while [newline &lt;&gt; char: first connection] [
    print char
]
</pre>
<p>When the communications is complete, the connection should be closed:</p>
<pre>
close connection
</pre>
<p>You are now ready for the next connection on the listen port. You can
<b><tt>wait</tt></b> again and use <b><tt>first</tt></b> again to get the
connection.</p>
<p>When you are done with serving, you can close the listen port with:</p>
<pre>
close listen
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-14.3">14.3 A Tiny Server</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is a useful REBOL server that only requires a few lines of code. This
server evaluates whatever REBOL code is sent to it. Lines of REBOL are read from
the client until an error occurs. Each line must be a complete REBOL expression.
They can be of any length but must be a single line.</p>
<pre>
server-port: open/lines tcp://:4321

forever [
    connection-port: first server-port
    until [
        wait connection-port
        error? try [do first connection-port]
    ]
    close connection-port
]
close server-port
</pre>
<p>If an error occurs, the connection is closed and the server waits for the
next connection.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a client script that allows you to enter REBOL command
lines remotely:</p>
<pre>
server: open/lines tcp://localhost:4321
until [error? try [insert server ask "R&gt; "]]
close server
</pre>
<p>Here the query is used to determine if the connection was been closed due to
an error.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-14.4">14.4 Testing TCP Code</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To test your server code, connect from your own machine, rather than
requiring both a server and a client. This can be done from two separate REBOL
processes or even from the same process.</p>
<p>To connect to your local machine, you can use a line such as:</p>
<pre>
port: open tcp://localhost:8001
</pre>
<p>Here is an example that makes two ports connect to each other in line mode.
This is a sort of <tt>echo</tt> port since you're sending data to
yourself. It provides a good test of your code and networking:</p>
<pre>
listen: open/lines tcp://:8001
remote: open/lines tcp://localhost:8001
local: first listen
insert local "How are you?"
print first remote  ; response
close local
close remote
close listen
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="section-15">15. UDP - User Datagram Protocol</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The User Datagram Protocol is another transport layer protocol that provides
a connectionless method of communicating between machines. It allows you to send
datagrams, packets, between machines.</p>
<p>The operation of UDP is much different than TCP. UDP is simpler, but it is
essentially unreliable. There is no guarantee that a packet will ever reach its
destination. In addition, UDP has no flow control. If you send messages too
quickly, packets may be lost.</p>
<p>Like TCP, the <b><tt>wait</tt></b> function can be used to wait for the next
packet to arrive and the <b><tt>copy</tt></b> function is used to return the
data. If there is no data, <b><tt>copy</tt></b> waits until there is. Note,
however, that <b><tt>insert</tt></b> never waits.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a simple UDP server script:</p>
<pre>
udp: open udp://:9999
wait udp
print copy udp
insert udp "response"
close udp
</pre>
<p>The messages inserted here by the server are sent to the client the server
last received a message from. This allows responses to be sent for incoming
messages. However, unlike TCP you do not have a continuous connection between
the machines. Each packet transfer is a separate exchange.</p>
<p>The client script to communicate with the above server would be:</p>
<pre>
udp: open udp://localhost:9999
insert udp "Test"
wait udp
print copy udp
close udp
</pre>
<p>You should know that the maximum UDP packet size depends on the operating
system. 32 KB and 64 KB are common values. In order to send larger amounts of
data, you will need to buffer the data, chopping it into smaller pieces.
However, careful programming is required to make sure that each piece of the
data is received. Remember that with UDP, there are no guarantees.</p>
